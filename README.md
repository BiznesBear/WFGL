# WFGL
Windows forms game liblary. 
> [!NOTE]
> WFGL was created as a 4fun project. This *library* was not created with the intention of creatin large games in it (or even anything in it). Treat this project as a kind of joke/meme. 
> The structure of this project is more like game engine than actually game library.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> WFGL uses GDI+ graphics which may result in low fps if there are too many sprites on scene.
