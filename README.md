# WFGL
"Windows forms game library" allows you to create small 2D games faster and simpler (in windows forms, of course). 

> [!NOTE]
> WFGL was created as a 4fun project. This *library* was not created with the intention of creatin large games in it (or even anything in it). 
> Treat this project as a kind of joke/meme. 
> The structure of this project is more like game engine than actually game library.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> WFGL uses GDI+ graphics which may result in low fps if there are too many bitmaps on view. 

## 📄 General futures 
- Auto scaling
- Very basic physics
- Basic object managment
- Optimalizations
- UI


## 🎈 Install by Cloning
```
$ https://github.com/BiznesBear/WFGL.git
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need minimum .NET 9.0 to use WFGL.

When you create a new console project you have to set target platform to Windows and add
```
<UseWindowsForms>true</UseWindowsForms>
```
to your project file.



## ⚙️ TODO list
- Make view can be not only in the square 
- Time manipulation (or just better time managment)
- 2.5D
- Pseudo (2D) light
- Optimalizations
- More ui
- Editor/Game engine based on this library (WFGE)
- Object pivots and parenting (sub-objects)
- Add more error handling and debugging tools.
