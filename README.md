# 🗑️ WFGL
"Windows forms game library" allows you to create small 2D games faster and simplier (in windows forms, of course). 

> [!NOTE]
> WFGL was created as a 4fun project. 
> This *library* was not created with the intention of creatin large games in it (or even anything in it). 
> Also contains huge amounts of spagetti code.
> Treat this as a kind of joke/meme. 

## 📄 General futures 
- Auto scaling
- Object managment
- Small optimalizations
- Very basic ui


## 🎈 Install by Cloning
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need minimum .NET 9.0 to build WFGL

When you create a new console project you have to set target platform to Windows and add this to your project file.
```csproj
<UseWindowsForms>true</UseWindowsForms>
```
