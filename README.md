# WFGL
Windows forms game liblary.
 > [!NOTE]
 > WFGL was created as a 4fun project. This *library* was not created with the intention of creatin large games in it (or even anything in it). Treat this project as a kind of joke/meme. The structure of this project is more like game engine than actually game library.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Everything in WFGL is rendered on CPU because we are using System.Drawing (GDI+) which may result in low fps.
