# WFGL
"Windows forms game library" allows you to create small 2D games faster and simpler (in windows forms, of course). 

> [!NOTE]
> WFGL was created as a 4fun project. This *library* was not created with the intention of creatin large games in it (or even anything in it). 
> Treat this project as a kind of joke/meme. 
> The structure of this project is more like game engine than actually game library.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> WFGL uses GDI+ graphics which may result in low fps if there are too many bitmaps on view.
