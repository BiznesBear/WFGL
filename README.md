# WFGL
"Windows forms game library" allows you to create small 2D games faster and simplier (in windows forms, of course). 

> [!NOTE]
> WFGL was created as a 4fun project. This *library* was not created with the intention of creatin large games in it (or even anything in it). 
> Treat this as a kind of joke/meme. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> WFGL uses GDI+ graphics which may result in low fps. 

## 📄 General futures 
- Auto scaling
- Object managment
- Small optimalizations
