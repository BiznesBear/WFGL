 Windows forms game liblary.
 > [!NOTE]
 > WFGL was created as a 4fun project. This *library* was not created with the intention of creatin large games in it (or even anything in it). Treat this project as a kind of joke/meme.
> [!WARRING]
> Everything in WFGL is rendered on CPU which may result in low fps. WFGL tries to prevent this with some optimizations.
